Personal Pet-projects with advanced techniques for using the JS-language.

1. To watch Browser events technique (12_browser-events) use https://makrovan.github.io/JS-advanced/12_browser-events/index.html
2. To watch my ToDo application (13_modules) download [my docker-compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makrovan/JS-advanced/main/13_modules/docker-compose.yml) and then run `docker-compose up`
3. To watch working with asynchronous events (14_async-event-loop) in my `StarWars StoryBook` run `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 makrov/async-event-app` and then go to http://localhost:3000
4. To watch error handling technique (15_errors) docker run -d -p 3000:3000 makrov/errors-backend and then open [index.html](https://makrovan.github.io/JS-advanced/15_errors/02/client/index.html)
5. To watch working with classes in my game "Pairs" (16_classes) run `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 makrov/pairs-card` and then go to http://localhost:3000
6. To watch my tool showing a chain of object prototypes (17_advanced-objects) run `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 makrov/object-prototype` and then go to http://localhost:3000
7. To watch my Card validation tool, builded by 'webpack' (18_ecosystem) run docker run -d -p 8080:80 makrov/card-validator and then go to http://localhost:8080 (it runs in Nginx - container)
8. The last directory (20_testing) is example of 'jest' and 'Cypress' (e2e) testing

All folders have their own README-files that describes the tasks to them.
